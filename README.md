# bruun_fft
bruun's fft algorithm for c and python https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruun%27s_FFT_algorithm
* if you came here you were hoping to find an implementation
* you are not alone
* I am collecting information and seeking implementations that can be helpful to convert
* I am looking for anything in fortran or matlab if you have it

# goals
* implement bruun's fft in numpy
* use claude sonnet to build analysis frameworks and use sympy to fully break down shuffling
* find an inplace shuffling methodology(this could make for a great research paper!)
* figure out a bruun ifft(another great research paper, as none exists!)
* figure out if bruun's approach can be more optimal on modern cpu than C-T or sorenson(not likely)
